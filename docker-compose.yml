# .yml file defines a single service built grom the Dockerfile.

# only command so far is yo echo "ready" and exit.
# the volume line /home/app/chat, when used with ./, mounts a tells docker the path on
# the host relative to the Compose file in the container. This is key so that changes
# made to the source files on the host are automatically reflected inside the container, and viceversa.
# 2 potential issues w/ above volume line: how npm installs dependencies and making user the Linux User
# Identifier (UID) of the host and of the container match.
